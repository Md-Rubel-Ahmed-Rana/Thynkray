## Tech Stack and Third-Party Libraries

### Core Language & Frameworks

- **TypeScript**: Strongly typed superset of JavaScript used across both frontend and backend for better developer experience, type safety, and tooling.
- **Next.js**: React-based full-stack framework used on the frontend. Enables file-based routing, SSR/SSG, API routes, and tight integration with NextAuth.
- **NestJS**: Modular, scalable Node.js framework on the backend. Used to build the REST API with features like validation, logging, scheduling, and event-driven architecture

### Databases & ORM

- **PostgreSQL**: Reliable, open-source relational database for storing structured app data including users, articles, and metadata.
- **Prisma**: Modern, type-safe ORM for querying PostgreSQL. Handles migrations, schema definitions, and database interaction in NestJS.
- **Redis**: In-memory data store used for caching responses and improving app performance (e.g., caching articles or search queries).
- **Meilisearch**: A powerful, ultra-fast full-text search engine used for searching blog articles with typo tolerance and relevance-based results.

### Authentication & Authorization

- **NextAuth.js**: Authentication framework for Next.js. Supports OAuth providers like Google OAuth session management.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Used server-side for stateless authentication and secure API access.

### File Uploads & Storage

- **Multer**: Middleware used in NestJS to handle file uploads (images, etc.) from the frontend.

- **Google Drive API**: Used to store uploaded images (user profile pictures or blog banners) securely in Google Drive. URLs are stored in the database.

### Event-driven & Scheduled Tasks

- **Event Emitter (nestjs/event-emitter)**: Adds support for an event-driven architecture, where parts of the app can listen for and respond to specific eventsâ€”like Adding articles/posts on **Redis** and **Meilisearch**, Delete images from **Google Drive** when a post deleted or updated or user profile image updated.
- **Cron Job (nestjs/schedule)**: Allows scheduling of cron jobs or interval-based background tasks. Ideal for tracking and keeping data consistency** on **PostgreSQL**, **Redis**, and **Meilisearch**.

### Frontend Libraries & UI

- **Material UI (MUI)**: UI component library for React. Provides modern, accessible design components and icons.
- **React Hook Form**: Lightweight, performant library for managing form state and validation.
- **React Quill**: Rich text editor used for writing and editing blog posts with formatting.
- **Swiper**: Modern mobile touch slider for carousels, image galleries, and featured content.
- **React Animated Cursor**: Adds custom animated cursor UI to enhance site interactivity

### State Management

- **TanStack Query**: TanStack Query is configurable down to each observer instance of a query with knobs and options to fit every use-case. Simpler and lighter than Redux.

### Developer Experience & Backend Utilities

- **Class Validator**: Validates incoming data using decorators in NestJS DTOs.
- **Class Transformer**: Transforms raw data into class instances and helps with serialization/deserialization.
- **Swagger**: Auto-generates interactive API docs for backend routes and DTOs in NestJS.
- **Pino + Pino Pretty**: High-speed JSON logger used in NestJS. pino-pretty formats logs nicely during development.
- **NewsAPI**: Third-party news aggregator API. Optionally used to fetch and display trending external content.

### Utilities & UX Enhancements

- **Axios**: A promise-based HTTP client is used on both frontend and backend for making API requests and integrations.
- **Day.js and Moment.js**: Lightweight libraries for formatting and manipulating dates.
- **Framer Motion**: Powerful animation library for React. Used to animate page transitions, modals, and interactive elements.

- **Lenis**: Smooth scroll library that improves scrolling behavior and feel across devices.
